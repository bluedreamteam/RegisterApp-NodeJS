 # Basic description
Browser based register application that interacts with a PostgreSQL database. Implemented in NodeJS with typescript, express, and the sequelize ORM. Edited in Visual Studio Code.  
  
If a "PORT" environment variable has not been defined then the application currently defaults to port 15100 (see ./src/app.ts).  

To start via the terminal navigate to the source code directory and run the following commands (after install "rebuild" will be run automatically)...  
`$ npm install`  
`$ npm run (re)build`  
`$ npm run start`
